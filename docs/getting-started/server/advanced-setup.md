# Advanced Server Setup

Once you have your server up and running, there may be some additional configuration required to
activate all of Bitwarden's features.

## Premium Features

The user secrets file includes a test Stripe key, which will allow you to "buy" premium features
without actually being charged.

1. Connect to your local server with the web client
2. When purchasing a subscription or premium, use the credit card payment method using testing data
   from [Stripe documentation](https://stripe.com/docs/testing#cards):

   | Brand      | Number                | CVC         | Date            |
   | ---------- | --------------------- | ----------- | --------------- |
   | Visa       | `4111 1111 1111 1111` | Any 3 digit | Any future date |
   | Mastercard | `5555 5555 5555 4444` | Any 3 digit | Any future date |

3. Your credit card details will only need to pass the front-end form validation (e.g. your credit
   card number will need to be the correct number of characters).
4. Buy premium features to your heart's content

## Emails

Docker compose will spin up a local smtp server that can be used, but itâ€™s also possible to use
other services such as Mailtrap, or Amazon to debug the amazon integration.

- Amazon Simple Email Service - the user secrets vault item includes a separate attachment called
  `amazon_key_for_email.json`. Add this key to your user secrets to use Amazon's mail service.
  Caution: this will send emails to real live email addresses!
- [bytemark/docker-smtp](https://github.com/BytemarkHosting/docker-smtp) - a local SMTP server
  running on Docker.

## File Uploads (File Sends and Attachments)

File uploads are stored using one of two methods.

- Azure Storage is used by our production cloud instance.

  - Docker will create a local [Azurite](https://github.com/Azure/Azurite) instance which emulates
    the Azure Storage API. And is used for the primary testing.
  - We also have a test Azure Storage account for development use. The user secrets for this are
    attached to the the "Server User Secrets" shared vault item. You'll need to copy the `send` and
    `attachment` keys into your own user secrets.

- Direct upload is used by self-hosted instances and stores the file directly on the server. The
  following settings will allow you to upload files, but not download them. Put the following
  settings under `globalSettings` (update the paths as required):

  ```json
  "send": {
      "baseDirectory": "/Users/<your name>/Projects/localStorageDev",
      "baseUrl": "file:///Users/<your name>/Projects/localStorageDev"
  },
  "attachment": {
      "baseDirectory": "/Users/<your name>/Projects/localStorageDev",
      "baseUrl": "file:///Users/<your name>/Projects/localStorageDev"
  }
  ```

  :::note

  To properly test uploading and downloading files using direct upload, you need to set up a local
  file server. Please add instructions here if you do this :)

## PayPal

If you just need premium features, it's easier to pay by card (see the instructions above). However,
you may need to test the PayPal integration specifically.

1. Make sure you are using the `secrets.json` from the shared Engineering collection. These secrets
   provide access to the PayPal sandbox account, which will be automatically used when running the
   server locally.
2. You need 2 PayPal sandbox accounts for testing:
   - a seller - this will be our sandbox account. Login details are available in the shared
     Engineering collection. You can log in to this account to see a record of (fake) money received
     by Bitwarden in any transactions you process.
   - a buyer - this will use your sandbox account.
3. [Create a new PayPal sandbox account](https://www.sandbox.paypal.com) using your work email
   address. You can then
   [create fake buyer accounts](https://developer.paypal.com/docs/api-basics/sandbox/accounts/) with
   any particular personal information you might require (e.g. country, payment methods). This is
   particularly useful when testing sales tax. You can use the
   [credit card generator](https://developer.paypal.com/developer/creditCardGenerator/) to generate
   "valid" fake credit card details if required.
4. Log in to your web vault and navigate to a payment page. All PayPal payment features should work
   using your sandbox account, or the fake buyer account you created.

Note: if you are testing sales tax, you will first have to create sales tax rates via the Admin
portal.

## Reverse Proxy Setup

Running a reverse proxy can be used to simulate running multiple server services in a distributed
manner. The [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) configuration in the `/dev` folder
already has a configuration prepared for the Api and Identity services (can be expanded for other
services).

1. The reverse proxy container is setup to use an
   [nginx](https://nginx.org/en/docs/beginners_guide.html#conf_structure) config file located at
   `dev/reverse-proxy.conf`. Copy the example reverse proxy configuration:

   ```bash
   cd dev
   cp reverse-proxy.conf.example reverse-proxy.conf
   ```

2. Optionally modify `reverse-proxy.conf` to support the number of desired services and their ports.
   By default it supports two **Api** and two **Identity** services running on ports **4000/4002**
   and **33656/33658**, respectively.

3. Ensure environment variables `API_PROXY_PORT` and `IDENTITY_PROXY_PORT` are present in
   `dev/.env`. See `dev/.env.example` for defaults.

4. Launch the reverse proxy using docker compose.

   ```bash
   docker compose --profile proxy up -d
   ```

5. Spin up the required services locally, using a unique port for each running instance. **The ports
   must match the ports in the `reverse-proxy.conf` in the `upstream` configuration blocks.**

   - **Command line** _(in separate terminals)_
     ```bash
     # 1st instance
     cd src/Api
     dotnet run --urls=http://localhost:4000/
     ```
     ```bash
     # 2nd instance: --no-build can avoid conflicts with the first instance
     cd src/Api
     dotnet run --urls=http://localhost:4002/ --no-build
     ```
   - **Rider** - Create new launch configurations for the desired services with each using a
     different port in the `ASPNETCORE_URLS` environment variable. Then run/debug each configuration
     simultaneously.
   - **Visual Studio** - You can add additional run configurations for each service to use unique
     ports, similar to Rider. _You may need to run multiple instances of Visual Studio in order to
     run/debug the same project._

     > _Be careful of accidental commits of launch configuration changes_

6. Update any clients to use the reverse proxy instead of the service(s) directly. These ports are
   defined in `dev/.env` and `dev/reverse-proxy.conf`.
   - **Api** - `http://localhost:4100`
   - **Identity** - `http://localhost:33756`

> If you need to add additional services (besides Api and Identity), add them to the
> `dev/reverse-proxy.conf` and make sure the necessary ports are exposed in the
> `dev/docker-compose.yml` file for the `reverse-proxy` container.
