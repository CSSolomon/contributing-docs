# iOS Mobile app

## Requirements

- dotnet Core 2.0 (latest)
- dotnet Core 3.1 (latest)
- Xamarin (iOS)
- A Mac with Xcode installed

## Apple Developer Account Setup

1. Accept your invite to the Bitwarden Apple Developer team. You should get a request in your email
   with the subject "You're invited to join a development team." Click the link, "Accept Invitation"
   and you'll be prompted to create an Apple ID for your <http://bitwarden.com> email address. If
   you didn't receive this email, contact the IT department (@IT in slack). Accept the terms and
   conditions and complete the sign up flow

2. Go to [Apple ID Online](https://appleid.apple.com/) and log in with your new Apple ID. Set up
   2-factor authentication (using mobile phone and/or trusted device) - this is critical because
   Apple no longer allows "developer" accounts without MFA, but it won't tell you that when your
   build fails locally

3. Go to [App Store Connect](https://appstoreconnect.apple.com/) and accept the terms and conditions

4. Ensure you have access to the Bitwarden team and team app profiles

5. Go to [Apple Developer Account](https://developer.apple.com/account/) and go to the
   "Certificates, IDs & Profiles" menu item. Check that you can see the 8bit Solutions LLC
   Certificates in the Certificates section, and the Bitwarden profiles in the Profiles section. If
   any of this is missing, ask the IT department (@IT #tech-support in slack) for the additional
   roles / permissions

## MacOS Setup

Next, you need to get your Mac environment set up for building and running the Bitwarden iOS mobile
project. This requires creating the necessary developer provisioning profiles for code signing and
execution on your Mac through Xcode. Visual Studio has a simple process to get all of the
provisioning profiles, however this is prone to fail without much feedback. Try the Visual Studio
instructions ("The Easy Way") first, and fallback to the Xcode instructions (“The Hard Way”) if
required.

### Visual Studio: The Easy Way

1.  Open Visual Studio for Mac

2.  Go to Preferences > Publishing > Apple Developer Accounts

3.  Click “Add”, choose "Enterprise Account", and sign in with your previously configured Apple
    Developer account

    :::note

    If you receive a "Failed to synchronize with Apple Developer Portal" error, you’re missing
    additional roles / permissions.

    :::

    After signing in successfully, you should see your account in the list and “Bitwarden Inc” in
    the account teams list

4.  Click “View Details…”

5.  If you don’t have a valid Apple Development certificate, click Create certificate > Apple
    Development

6.  Click “Download All Profiles”

7.  You should now be able to run the app by setting
    `iOS > Debug | iPhone Simulator > [pick any iOS Simulator]` in the top left corner and pressing
    Play

If this worked, you can skip the next section.

### Xcode: The Hard Way

:::note

If you're the next person to follow these instructions, please commit and upload the Xcode project
files you create so we can streamline this process.

:::

Only try these instructions if the Visual Studio instructions above didn't work for you.

1.  Open Xcode

2.  Accept any defaults, ensure any extensions/add-ons have been installed, etc.

3.  Create new project... > iOS > App

4.  Use the following options for your new project:

    - Product Name: "bitwarden"

    - Team: Bitwarden Inc (if this is missing, double check your Apple Developer Account setup
      above)

    - Organization Identifier: "com.8bit"

    - Bundle Identifier (automatically generated): "com.8bit.bitwarden"

    - Language: Objective-C

    - User Interface: Storyboard

    - Leave all other checkboxes unchecked (or uncheck them)

    ![Example configuration for new Xcode project](./new-project-options.png)

5.  Click Next, save to the default location and then click "Create"

6.  On the project configuration page, click the "Signing & Capabilities" tab

7.  Make sure you have the following defaults:

    - Automatically manage signing: (checked)

    - Team: Bitwarden Inc

    - Provisioning Profile: Xcode Managed Profile

    - Signing Certificate: your Apple ID/Name

    ![Example configuration for Signing & Capabilities screen](./signing-and-capabilities.png)

8.  From the menu bar, click Product > Build

9.  Repeat Steps 3-8, with the following changes in step 4:

    - Product Name: "find-login-action-extension"

    - Organization Identifier: "com.8bit.bitwarden"

    - Bundle Identifier (automatically generated): "com.8bit.bitwarden.find-login-action-extension"

10. Repeat Steps 3-8, with the following changes in step 4:

    - Product Name: "autofill"

    - Organization Identifier: "com.8bit.bitwarden"

    - Bundle Identifier (automatically generated): "com.8bit.bitwarden.autofill"

11. Repeat Steps 3-8, with the following changes in step 4:

    - Product Name: "share-extension"

    - Organization Identifier: "com.8bit.bitwarden"

    - Bundle Identifier (automatically generated): "com.8bit.bitwarden.share-extension"

12. If you have a physical device (e.g. iPhone or iPad) that you want to use for testing, you will
    also need to do the following for each of the Xcode projects you just created:

    - connect the device with a cable

    - select your device as as the build target in Xcode

    - from the menu bar, click Product > Build

    - agree to register your device if asked

    :::note

    Sometimes these profiles can mess up. If you have issues running on your physical device (or
    simulator) try running `rm -r ~/Library/MobileDevice/Provisioning\ Profiles` to clear them out.
    Build each Xcode project again to regenerate them.

    :::

## Visual Studio

Next, we need to configure your Visual Studio environment for development.

<Tabs groupId="os">
<TabItem value="win" label="Windows" default>

1. Connect to the Mac that you just completed the above steps on

2. Open Visual Studio and click Tools > iOS > Pair to Mac

3. Scan for and select your machine. If you don't see it, click the "Add Mac..." button and put in
   the Mac name or IP address. If you don't know your Mac name (or you're in a Windows VM on your
   Mac), go to your Mac and open System Preferences > Sharing and look for the ".local" address of
   your machine

4. Provide your Username and Password for MacOS when prompted

5. Once paired, close the Pair Mac window

6. Change your active build profile to Debug > iPhoneSimulator > iOS

7. Rebuild the iOS project from Solution Explorer

8. You can now debug using the iOS Simulator

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="mac" label="macOS">

1. Check that command line tools are installed:

   1. Open Xcode

   2. From the menu bar, click Xcode > Preferences > Locations

   3. Make sure an Xcode version is selected under "Command Line Tools"

2. Open Visual Studio for Mac

3. Open the mobile solution file (`bitwarden-mobile.sln`) in the root of your local mobile
   repository

4. In the top bar, you should be able to select iOS > iPhoneSimulator > select your model and click
   run (or your physical device if you set one up)

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Debugging

### iPhone Simulator

The iPhone Simulator has access to localhost and you can point the client at your local dev server
as usual. However, the app will require https by default. To allow http for testing purposes, follow
these steps.

1. Open `src/iOS/Info.plist` in Visual Studio Code or another editor so that you can edit the raw
   XML. (Don't use the Property List Editor in Visual Studio.)

2. Add the following code in the top-level `<dict>` element:

   ```xml
   <key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
   <dict>
       <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
       <false/>
       <key>NSExceptionDomains</key>
       <dict>
           <key>localhost</key>
           <dict>
               <key>NSExceptionAllowsInsecureHTTPLoads</key>
               <true/>
               <key>NSIncludesSubdomains</key>
               <true/>
           </dict>
       </dict>
   </dict>
   ```

3. Save and exit `Info.plist`

4. Press <kbd>Command</kbd> + <kbd>B</kbd> to force a new build before launching

5. Don't push these changes :)

### iPhone device

The device doesn’t have direct access to your Mac’s localhost, so you can follow
[this guide to connect them](https://ymoondhra.medium.com/how-to-run-localhost-on-your-iphone-4110a54d1896).

After you do that, you’ll have to also modify the `Info.plist` to allow http for testing purposes as
explained before on the simulator testing.

It’s also highly likely that you need to change the `launchSettings.json` on Server, on `Properties`
of each project. There you need to change the `applicationUrl` of `iisSettings -> iisExpress` and of
`profiles -> Identify` so that instead of `localhost` it says `name.local` where `name` is the
computer name you set on Mac’s Sharing config.

Before you actually test on the app, open a browser and try to connect to the `Api` by going to
`http://name.local:4000/alive` . If this doesn’t work then review the steps on the guide or the
server configuration. Make sure you have your `User secrets` up to date as well.

Finally, you’ll have to configure the `Api` and `Identity` urls on the phone to use
`http://name.local:4000` and `http://name.local:33656` where `name` is the computer name you set on
Mac’s Sharing config.

### iOS Extensions

1. Set the iOS Extension project as Startup project

2. Press Run

3. You will receive a popup saying "Waiting for the debugger to connect..."

4. Don’t open the Bitwarden app (otherwise the debugger will connect to it instead of the
   extension). Instead trigger the extension

5. Your extension breakpoints should now be hit

For example: if you want to debug the **iOS.Autofill** extension, you would complete steps 1 - 3,
then go to your iOS device, open a browser, go to a login, tap the key icon and open Bitwarden from
the bottom popup.

### Reverse Proxy Your Localhost Server With ngrok

Since your physical device and server are not directly running on the same machine, it's more complex to connect them. Although, there is an easy way to solve this problem, connect your mobile deployment (Emulator or Device) to your local server by creating a reverse proxy for the `api` and `identity` using [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/). ngrok will create public endpoints for your localhost server that you can connect to with your mobile app.

1. install `ngrok`, can be done using brew: 
```ngrok
brew install --cask ngrok
```
2. Use ngrok to create a reverse proxy for the api using its local port (default 4000)
```
ngrok http 4000
```
3. Use ngrok to create a reverse proxy for the identity using its local port (default 33656)
```
ngrok http 33656
```
4. Copy the urls generated by the ngrok to the apps Environment setup screen. Since the ngrok proxy urls are a bit long, you can also replace the ApiBaseUrl and IdentityBaseUrl in `Mobile -> Core -> Services -> ApiService` and deploy your app.
